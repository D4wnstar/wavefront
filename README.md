A repository of personal experiments in scientific computation using Julia. There is no real connection between different parts of this repository: it's all just things I felt like trying out, either for fun or because they might come in handy in the future. All code and images are found in `src` in the appropriate subfolder.

As of current, there are:
- diffraction patterns for a few slit shapes (1D, 2D rectangle, 2D circle)
- fractal plotting
- quantum wavefunctions
- an implementation of a Kohonen neural network
