A repository of personal experiments in scientific computation using Julia. There is no real connection between different parts of this repository: it's all just things I just felt like trying out, either for fun or because they might come in handy in the future.

As of current, there are:
- accurate diffraction patterns for a few slit shapes (1D, 2D rectangle, 2D circle)
- fractal plotting
